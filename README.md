This is a repository for my book "Game Startup Manual: Game Design"

I share the same approach as Andry Burkov’s books, following the “read first, buy later” principle. This means that readers have the option to download and read book chapters for free before making a purchase. This practice is harmless and beneficial to readers.

## Prologue 
This book is the first and part of the “Game Startup Manual” series, a book collection for game startup enthusiasts. We will provide another title, including game programming, game development, operational management, business and marketing plan, hopefully.

Particularly, this book is intended to be a guide for game startup founders, game designers, and game developers who want to make engaging and profitable games that stand out in the crowded game market. You will learn about the role of games in entertainment, education, and social interaction, as well as the benefits that games can bring to players and society. You will also discover the importance of fun and engagement in game design, as well as different types of games and platforms. The book covers the game design process, essential skills and knowledge of game design, and the different roles and responsibilities involved in creating a game. You will also learn about game mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics, as well as the principles of game balance, pacing, and difficulty that contribute to a compelling player experience. The book also covers the importance of game documents and the prototyping and playtesting phase of game development. By the end of this book, you will have the tools, skills, and knowledge to create meaningful games that players love.

It’s important to keep in mind that this book is primarily based on the author’s personal experience and references from the game industry. As a result, not all of the approaches outlined in the book may align with your preferences. Nonetheless, reading this book will provide you valuable knowledge.
